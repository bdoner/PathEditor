PathEditor is an F# console based editor for your windows environment `PATH` variable both for the entire machine or the current user.

To build it yourself run `msbuild.exe` against `PathEditor.sln`. It is tested to build with MsBuild version 14 and 15.

Alternatively you can get a prebuilt binary under [Releases](https://github.com/bdoner/PathEditor/releases)
